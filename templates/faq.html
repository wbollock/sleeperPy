        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="privacy-section">
            <h3>What are tiers and how do they work?</h3>
            <p>
                Tiers are groupings of players based on expert consensus rankings, created by
                <a href="https://www.borischen.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color:#7bb0ff;">Boris Chen</a>.
                Players in the same tier are expected to perform similarly that week.
                For example, all Tier 1 QBs are roughly equivalent, and significantly better than Tier 3 QBs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The key insight: within the same tier, the difference between players is small.
                Between tiers, the difference is meaningful. This helps you avoid agonizing over choices between similarly-ranked players.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
            <h3>How do I find my Sleeper username?</h3>
            <p>
                Open the Sleeper app, go to <strong>Settings</strong> (gear icon), and look for your username near the top of the page.
                It's the name that starts with @. Enter it without the @ symbol.
            </p>
            <p>
                For more details, see
                <a href="https://support.sleeper.com/en/articles/1876011-account-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color:#7bb0ff;">Sleeper's account settings guide</a>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
            <h3>How often do tiers update?</h3>
            <p>
                Boris Chen's tiers are updated weekly during the NFL season, typically by Wednesday.
                SleeperPy caches tier data for 15 minutes, so you'll see updates shortly after they're published.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the offseason, tiers may not be available. Dynasty features (player values, trade targets, etc.) are available year-round.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
            <h3>What's the difference between Standard, Half PPR, and PPR?</h3>
            <p>
                These are scoring formats that affect how players are ranked:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard</strong> &mdash; No points per reception</li>
                <li><strong>Half PPR</strong> &mdash; 0.5 points per reception</li>
                <li><strong>PPR</strong> &mdash; 1 point per reception</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                SleeperPy automatically detects your league's scoring format and uses the appropriate tier rankings.
                PPR leagues value pass-catching players (especially WRs and pass-catching RBs) more highly.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
            <h3>What is dynasty mode?</h3>
            <p>
                Dynasty mode provides analysis tools for dynasty (keeper) leagues where you keep players across seasons.
                It includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dynasty values</strong> &mdash; Long-term player valuations from DynastyProcess</li>
                <li><strong>Draft capital tracking</strong> &mdash; See which draft picks you own across future years</li>
                <li><strong>Trade targets</strong> &mdash; Find teams with complementary positional needs</li>
                <li><strong>Breakout candidates</strong> &mdash; Young bench players with high upside</li>
                <li><strong>Aging player alerts</strong> &mdash; Players approaching decline age thresholds</li>
                <li><strong>League power rankings</strong> &mdash; Compare your team's value and record against the league</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Dynasty mode is automatically enabled for leagues detected as dynasty format.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
            <h3>How are dynasty values calculated?</h3>
            <p>
                Dynasty values come from
                <a href="https://dynastyprocess.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color:#7bb0ff;">DynastyProcess</a>,
                which aggregates multiple dynasty ranking sources. Values are on a 0-10,000 scale and are updated regularly.
            </p>
            <p>
                For superflex leagues, 2QB values are used which value QBs more highly.
                For standard leagues, 1QB values are used.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
            <h3>What do the colored indicators mean?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong style="color:#ffc83a;">&#9733; Gold star</strong> &mdash; Tier 1 player (elite)</li>
                <li><strong style="color:#3ae87a;">Green highlight</strong> &mdash; Free agent upgrade available</li>
                <li><strong style="color:#ff7b7b;">Red highlight</strong> &mdash; Starter with a better bench alternative</li>
                <li><strong style="color:#7bb0ff;">Blue FLEX badge</strong> &mdash; Player ranked using FLEX tier</li>
                <li><strong style="color:#7bb0ff;">&#8644; Swap icon</strong> &mdash; Bench player better than a current starter</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
            <h3>Why don't I see my league?</h3>
            <p>Possible reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your league may not have started yet for the current season</li>
                <li>You may have entered the wrong username (check capitalization)</li>
                <li>The Sleeper API may be temporarily unavailable</li>
                <li>Non-dynasty leagues require active matchups to display</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Dynasty leagues are visible even during the offseason when there are no active matchups.
            </p>
